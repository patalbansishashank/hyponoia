# package-release.sh — THE canonical release-archive step. Every venue that
# turns built binaries into a release archive (release/_build.yml, the local
# artifact-flow smoke lane) runs this file; workflows provide only
# checkout/toolchain/upload around it. Archive names and contents are defined
# HERE, nowhere else, so a local artifact smoke provably exercises the same
# bytes-layout the release publishes.
#
# This script ARCHIVES what scripts/build.sh already produced; it never builds
# or synthesizes another executable.

Usage: scripts/package-release.sh <goos> <goarch> [--variant standard|ui]
                                  [--out-dir DIR] [VAR=VAL ...]

The canonical release-archive step: identical in the release build and the
local artifact-flow smoke lane.

  goos       linux | darwin | windows
  goarch     arch label used verbatim in the archive name (amd64, arm64,
             arm64-portable, ...)
  --variant  standard (default) | ui — selects the archive NAME prefix; the
             matching binary must already have been built (--with-ui for ui).
             UI archives add exactly one root-level hyp-ui-<sha256>.pack.
  --out-dir  where to place the archive (default: repository root).

Make passthrough (VAR=VAL, forwarded to the build):
  CC= CXX=   compiler override, e.g. CC=clang CXX=clang++.

Environment:
  BUILD_DIR  build tree to archive from (default build/c).

Archive contents (defined here, canonical) — ONE executable per runtime set:
  unix:    hyponoia hyp-integrations.json LICENSE install.sh
           THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md [hyp-ui-<sha256>.pack] (.tar.gz)
  windows: hyponoia.exe hyp-integrations.json LICENSE install.ps1
           THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md [hyp-ui-<sha256>.pack] (.zip)

The bracketed pack is required only for the ui variant and forbidden from the
standard archive. The pack FORMAT is uncompressed before archiving; the tar/zip
container may compress it. Release extraction retains it as a standalone input
so scanners can inspect the frontend independently of the native image.

hyp-integrations.json is the integration-template data file: the binary
embeds only its SHA-256 and refuses to install integrations without a
verified copy, so an archive without it produces a binary that cannot
install. It ships NEXT TO the binary — the resolution path install.sh /
install.ps1 rely on when they run `install` from the extracted archive.

# Ship every release binary stripped. Production already builds without -g, but
# the linker still keeps a ~536 KB .symtab, so releases carried their full
# symbol table to users: bigger downloads and a free map of the internals, with
# nothing gained. Nothing symbolizes at runtime (mem_profile.c is not in the
# production build and never calls backtrace_symbols), so this costs no
# diagnostics.
#
# A historical unstripped linux-amd64 artifact was the sole Microsoft detection
# in release run 30398064336, while related stripped artifacts later scanned
# clean. That is useful release evidence but not controlled feature attribution:
# engine state and other bytes can differ between observations. Independently
# of the opaque verdict, stripping removes an unnecessary symbol surface and
# does not change program behavior.
#
# macOS is ad-hoc signed by the build workflow BEFORE this script runs, and
# stripping invalidates that signature, so Mach-O is re-signed here. Skipping
# the re-sign ships a binary the kernel refuses to exec.
