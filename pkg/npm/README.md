**The fastest and most efficient code intelligence engine for AI coding agents.** Full-indexes an average repository in milliseconds, the Linux kernel (28M LOC, 75K files) in 3 minutes. Answers structural queries in under 1ms. This npm wrapper downloads, verifies, and caches the selected native runtime set: the executable, its authenticated integration asset, and—when requested—the content-addressed UI pack.

High-quality parsing through [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) AST analysis across 159 languages — producing a persistent knowledge graph of functions, classes, call chains, HTTP routes, and cross-service links. 14 MCP tools. No hosted service or API key; this package requires Node.js to manage and launch the cached native runtime set. Plug and play across 43 automatic/conditional client surfaces.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g hyponoia
```

The standard runtime set for your platform is downloaded automatically at install time. To select the UI runtime set and its verified frontend pack, set `HYP_VARIANT=ui` while installing and when invoking the wrapper:

```bash
HYP_VARIANT=ui npm install -g hyponoia
```

Then configure your coding agents:

```bash
hyponoia install
```

Restart your agent. Say **"Index this project"** — done.

## Why hyponoia

- **Extreme indexing speed** — Linux kernel (28M LOC, 75K files) in 3 minutes. RAM-first pipeline with LZ4 compression and in-memory SQLite.
- **Plug and play** — verified native runtime sets for macOS (arm64/amd64), Linux (arm64/amd64), and Windows (arm64/amd64). No Docker or API keys; Node.js owns package download, cache repair, and launch.
- **159 languages** — vendored tree-sitter grammars compiled into the binary. Nothing to install, nothing that breaks.
- **120x fewer tokens** — 5 structural queries: ~3,400 tokens vs ~412,000 via file-by-file search.
- **43 supported automatic/conditional client surfaces** — `install` configures the appropriate MCP, durable-context, and documented hook surfaces without widening client permissions.
- **Detected automatically (37)** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Zed, OpenCode, Antigravity, Aider, KiloCode, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Augment / Auggie, OpenClaw, Kiro, Junie, Hermes, OpenHands, Cline, Warp, Qwen Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Factory Droid, Crush, Goose, Mistral Vibe, Qoder CLI, Kimi Code CLI, GitLab Duo CLI, Rovo Dev CLI, Amp, Devin CLI / Local, Tabnine, Amazon Q Developer IDE, CodeBuddy Code CLI, IBM Bob Shell, Pochi, and Pi.
- **Conditional or explicit (6)** — Continue / cn, Visual Studio, TRAE, Roo Code, IBM Bob IDE, and Sourcegraph Cody. Bob IDE is touched only when `~/.bob/mcp.json` already exists.
- **New documented adapters** — CodeBuddy uses `~/.codebuddy/.mcp.json` while preserving active older files; Bob Shell uses `~/.bob/mcp_settings.json`; Pochi uses the `mcp` section in `~/.pochi/config.jsonc`; Amazon Q Developer IDE defaults to `~/.aws/amazonq/default.json` while preserving either documented alternative.
- **Lifecycle hooks stay conservative** — Kimi uses `UserPromptSubmit`; on macOS/Linux, GitLab Duo gets a fail-open user `SessionStart`, while Devin gets `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostCompaction`, and a deduplicated `SessionStart` when Claude does not already provide it. Qoder, GitLab Duo, Devin, and Factory hooks are withheld on Windows without a documented shell/executor contract. Cline's auto-activating file hooks are withheld because their context output is not reliably consumed, CodeBuddy beta hooks are not auto-installed, and Cursor context hooks remain withheld.
- **Subagent access is explicit** — Claude, Gemini, Kiro, Qwen, CodeBuddy, KiloCode, Mistral Vibe, Qoder, Junie, and Factory get documented graph profiles with the narrowest tool/server filters their schemas support. KiloCode and Vibe enumerate read-only query tools rather than using server wildcards. Cursor, Rovo, Pochi, and Cline use explicit parent handoff where child MCP is unavailable or unsafe; IBM Bob receives no invented hook or agent.
- **Manual, UI, cloud, or repository-managed (not counted)** — Qodo, Warp MCP, JetBrains AI/ACP, GitHub Copilot coding agent, Jules, CodeRabbit, Replit, BLACKBOX AI, Plandex, and SWE-agent. Warp is counted above for its detected skill installation; its MCP connection remains manual.
- **14 MCP tools** — search, trace, architecture, impact analysis, Cypher queries, dead code detection, cross-service HTTP linking, ADR management, and more.

## Supported Platforms

| OS      | Architecture |
|---------|-------------|
| macOS   | arm64, amd64 |
| Linux   | arm64, amd64 |
| Windows | arm64, amd64 |

## Usage

```bash
hyponoia install          # configure all detected coding agents
hyponoia --version
hyponoia --help
hyponoia update           # update to latest release
hyponoia uninstall        # remove agent configs
```

### CLI Mode

Every MCP tool is also available directly from the command line:

```bash
hyponoia cli index_repository '{"repo_path": "/path/to/repo"}'
hyponoia cli search_graph '{"name_pattern": ".*Handler.*", "label": "Function"}'
hyponoia cli trace_call_path '{"function_name": "main", "direction": "both"}'
hyponoia cli get_architecture '{}'
```

## MCP Tools
