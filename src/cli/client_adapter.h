/*
 * client_adapter.h — Generate client extension modules from the MCP tool registry.
 *
 * Some clients have no MCP support (pi), and some have no declarative hook
 * configuration (OpenCode); their only extension point is a JavaScript/TypeScript
 * module. Generation splits along what each source is authoritative for:
 *
 *  - The module SCAFFOLDING (the node:child_process spawn bridge, header note,
 *    plugin surface) comes from the hash-verified hyp-integrations.json via
 *    integration_assets.h. It used to be compiled in as C string literals, but
 *    child-process-spawning script text inside a native binary is unnecessary
 *    mixed-content and attack surface with plausible static-classifier overlap.
 *    It therefore ships as independently inspectable data and is verified
 *    against the binary's embedded SHA-256 before use; this is not a claim of
 *    feature attribution for any vendor verdict.
 *
 *  - The TOOL LIST is still generated at install time from the live registry
 *    (hyp_mcp_tool_count / hyp_mcp_tool_name), never hand-maintained in the
 *    asset file: hand-maintained copies of the tool surface have already
 *    produced defects here. Adding a tool to TOOLS[] adds it to every
 *    generated adapter with no second edit — that property is preserved.
 *
 * Generated text is returned heap-allocated; the caller frees it. Nothing here
 * touches the filesystem — writing is the caller's job, so dry-run and
 * owned-block semantics stay in one place.
