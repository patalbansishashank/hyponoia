# Third-Party Licenses

This project vendors third-party code. We are grateful to the authors and
maintainers of these projects for making their work freely available.
Every vendored component directory carries the upstream `LICENSE`
(or `COPYING` / `NOTICE`) file alongside the sources.

## Tree-sitter Runtime

The tree-sitter C runtime is vendored in `internal/hyp/vendored/ts_runtime/`.

- **Project:** [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)
- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** (c) 2018–2024 Max Brunsfeld

**Local modification** (`internal/hyp/vendored/ts_runtime/src/stack.c`, #913): a
single HYP patch bounds the recursive ambiguity-merge in `stack_node_add_link`
at `HYP_TS_STACK_MERGE_MAX_DEPTH` (512). Deeply nested grammar-ambiguous input
(e.g. Perl `f(f(f(...)))`) otherwise recurses once per level on the native C
stack and overflows it during parsing (SIGSEGV on the ~1 MB Windows thread
stack, and even the 8 MB POSIX stack at extreme depth) before any extractor
runs. Past the cap the ambiguity is left on the GLR stack instead of merged —
still a valid parse, never a wrong one — mirroring the existing
`MAX_LINK_COUNT` bail-out. The change is clearly marked `// HYP patch:` inline.
**On re-vendor (e.g. ts_runtime → 0.26.x): re-apply this bound.**

The shared scanner helpers in `internal/hyp/vendored/common/` (`scanner.h`,
`tag.h`) originate from
[tree-sitter-html](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-html) (MIT,
(c) 2014 Max Brunsfeld) and carry that project's `LICENSE` in
`internal/hyp/vendored/common/`.

The core runtime headers in `internal/hyp/vendored/common/tree_sitter/`
(`alloc.h`, `array.h`, `parser.h`) are part of the tree-sitter C runtime
([tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter), MIT,
(c) 2018 Max Brunsfeld) and carry their own `LICENSE` in that directory.

## Tree-sitter Grammars

159 pre-generated parsers are vendored in `internal/hyp/vendored/grammars/<lang>/`
(generated `parser.c` plus `scanner.c` where applicable, compiled statically).
Each grammar is the work of its upstream authors and each grammar directory
contains the upstream `LICENSE` file.

The **canonical provenance record** — upstream repository, pinned commit, and
cross-registry verification status for every grammar — is
[`internal/hyp/vendored/grammars/MANIFEST.md`](internal/hyp/vendored/grammars/MANIFEST.md).

License summary:

- Nearly all grammars are **MIT**-licensed.
- `clojure` ([sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure)) is **CC0-1.0**;
  `fennel` is **CC0-1.0**; `jinja2` and `just` are **Apache-2.0**;
  `pine` is **ISC** (declared by its upstream).
- The grammars authored in-house for this project (`cobol`, `form`, `janet`,
  `magma`, `protobuf`, `wolfram`) are **MIT** under the project's own license,
  (c) DeusData. Six further grammars (`assembly`, `cfml`, `cfscript`,
  `dotenv`, `pine`, `qml`) are self-maintained forks that retain their
  original upstream authors' licenses — see the manifest for per-grammar
  provenance.

### tree-sitter-objectscript (UDL + routine)

- **Project:** [intersystems/tree-sitter-objectscript](https://github.com/intersystems/tree-sitter-objectscript)
- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** (c) 2025 InterSystems Corporation
- **Vendored at:** `internal/hyp/vendored/grammars/objectscript_udl/`, `internal/hyp/vendored/grammars/objectscript_routine/`
- **Pinned commit:** `a7ffcdf`
- **Notes:** InterSystems-maintained grammar for the ObjectScript language (InterSystems IRIS / Caché). Vendor-maintained; not in nvim-treesitter or Helix registries. Each `scanner.c`'s upstream `#include "../../common/scanner.h"` is repointed to a per-directory `objectscript_common.h` copied from upstream `common/scanner.h`; two loop counters in that copy are widened from `uint8_t` to `int` as documented in `internal/hyp/vendored/grammars/MANIFEST.md`.

Local modifications to these libraries are documented next to the
vendored sources (currently only SQLite: `vendored/sqlite3/PATCHES.md`,
raising the Unix VFS `MAX_PATHNAME` ceiling from 512 to 4096 to match
HYP's 4 KiB path support). Patches must be reapplied on every upstream
refresh and are covered by `scripts/vendored-checksums.txt`.

The graph-UI HTTP server is a first-party implementation
(`src/ui/httpd.c` + `src/ui/http_server.c`) — no third-party HTTP library
is used.

## Embedded Model Data

Semantic vector search uses static token embeddings derived from the
**nomic-embed-code** model, vendored in `vendored/nomic/`:

- **Model:** [nomic-ai/nomic-embed-code](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-code)
- **License:** Apache License 2.0
- **Copyright:** (c) Nomic AI

See `vendored/nomic/NOTICE` for the exact derivation procedure
(per-token inference + int8 quantization via `scripts/extract_nomic_vectors.py`).

These embeddings are being replaced by ones derived from the
**Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B** model, whose licence and attribution are already in
place in `vendored/qwen3/`:

- **Model:** [Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B)
- **License:** Apache License 2.0
- **Publisher:** Qwen team, Alibaba Group

Both entries are listed on purpose: `vendored/qwen3/` carries the licence for
the table that is arriving, and `vendored/nomic/` keeps the licence for the
table that is still linked into the binary. See `docs/EMBEDDING-SWAP.md` — the
nomic entry above is deleted in the same commit that deletes its vectors, and
not before.

A third directory, `vendored/qwen3-oldvocab/`, holds the same
Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B data derived over the *old* token list. It is covered by
the same Qwen3 licence and attribution above, is not linked into any build, and
exists only to separate the model delta from the vocabulary delta in the swap
measurement. It is expected to be deleted once that measurement is recorded —
see `vendored/qwen3-oldvocab/NOTICE`.

## Hybrid LSP — Reference Language Servers

The Hybrid LSP layer (`internal/hyp/lsp/`) is an original C implementation
written for this project. **It contains no source code from any language
server.** Its type-resolution behavior is structurally inspired by, and
validated for output compatibility against, the published behavior of the
following language servers and language specifications. They are listed here
as acknowledgment; their licenses are noted for reference:

| Language | Reference implementation / specification | Upstream license |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | tsserver ([microsoft/TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)), [typescript-go](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go) | Apache-2.0 |
| Python | [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) | MIT |
| Go | gopls ([golang/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools)) | BSD-3-Clause |
| PHP | PHP language reference + Composer PSR-4 autoloading specification | — |
| C# | Roslyn ([dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)) | MIT |
| C / C++ | clangd ([llvm/llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)) | Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception |
| Java | Java Language Specification; output parity with [Eclipse JDT LS](https://github.com/eclipse-jdtls/eclipse.jdt.ls) | EPL-2.0 (reference only) |
| Kotlin | Kotlin language specification; [fwcd/kotlin-language-server](https://github.com/fwcd/kotlin-language-server) | MIT |
| Rust | [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |

### Standard-library type data

The stdlib type registries in `internal/hyp/lsp/generated/` were produced as
follows:

- **Python** (`python_stdlib_data.c`) — generated from
  [python/typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed) type stubs
  (commit `a7912d521e16ff63caf7a8b64b9072542be36777`), **Apache-2.0**,
  (c) the typeshed contributors. The generator is `scripts/gen-py-stdlib.py`.
- **Go** (`go_stdlib_data.c`) — generated by introspecting the public API of
  the Go standard library ([golang/go](https://github.com/golang/go),
  BSD-3-Clause).
- **Java, Kotlin, C#, PHP, C/C++, Rust** — hand-curated from public API
  documentation and language specifications; no upstream source code was
  extracted or transcribed.

## External Graph UI asset pack

Release builds made with `--with-ui` ship the compiled `graph-ui/` frontend in
a deterministic, content-addressed `hyp-ui-<sha256>.pack` beside the native
executable. The executable contains only the expected pack name, size, and
SHA-256; it does not contain the HTML, JavaScript, or CSS payload.

The pack's npm dependencies (React, three.js, @react-three/*, radix-ui,
lucide-react, tailwindcss, and friends) are all under permissive licenses
(MIT / ISC / Apache-2.0 / Zlib). The exact set is recorded in
`graph-ui/package.json` and `graph-ui/package-lock.json`, and the per-package
license texts of the production bundle are appended to the
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` shipped inside each `-ui` release archive (generated
by `scripts/gen-ui-licenses.py`).
