# Contract: the native product must not embed integration or frontend bytes.
#
# The binary used to carry nine complete shebang'd shell scripts, their
# PowerShell/.cmd twins and the node:child_process client modules as C string
# literals — written to client config dirs at 0755. A block of script-shaped
# bytes inside a native executable is unnecessary mixed-content with plausible
# static-classifier overlap. That is a risk-reduction rationale, not feature
# attribution for an opaque vendor verdict. Those bodies now live in
# assets/hyp-integrations.json (hash-verified; the binary embeds only the
# SHA-256), and this contract is the proof the removal STAYS removed: one
# revived string literal would silently hand the next release its
# malware-shaped surface back, and nothing else in CI would notice.
#
# Two independent legs:
#   1. SOURCE: no production C source under src/ may contain a shebang or a
#      node:child_process literal. Absence at source level makes absence a
#      BUILD property of every artifact (standard, ui, all platforms) — not a
#      reachability assumption about any one binary.
#   2. ARTIFACT: when build/c/hyponoia exists, its bytes are scanned
#      directly. scripts/ci/check-binary-composition.sh runs the script needles
#      on every release variant (A6 and A7), so a
#      missing local build here skips only a redundant leg, never the property.
#
# Comment stripping is mandatory, not tidiness: a contract that a COMMENT can
# satisfy (or trip) is a false guard — see test_spawn_no_window_contract.sh,
# whose first version passed with its fix reverted because prose matched.
