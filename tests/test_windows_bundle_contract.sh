# INVERTED release-surface contract: Windows ships ONE executable plus its
# authenticated runtime assets.
#
# History this guards against. The Windows release used to be a PAIR — a small
# permanent launcher (hyponoia.exe) plus the real product binary
# (hyponoia.payload.exe). The launcher existed for exactly one
# reason: a running .exe cannot replace its own image on Windows, so an
# in-process self-update needs a second resident binary to do the swap.
#
# That stub was a small unsigned PE whose whole job was verify-and-execute
# another binary: unnecessary loader-like behavior and a second artifact to
# audit. Historical variants received Microsoft Wacatac verdicts, but those
# observations did not expose a stable feature or prove classifier causation.
#
# The fix removed the stub. The downloaded candidate now owns the complete
# runtime-set transaction under the native activation guard; install.ps1 only
# verifies/extracts and invokes it. In particular, the script must never retire
# the old executable or publish sidecars ahead of the guarded transaction.
#
# The non-launcher release/security assertions from the previous contract
# (VM-driver hardening, archive allowlists, HTTPS-only downloads, profile-rooted
# smoke fixtures, PR-smoke delegation) are preserved below.
